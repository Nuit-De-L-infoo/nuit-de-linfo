# GreenIT Development Challenge

## Overview
This challenge focuses on integrating ecological considerations into software development, aiming to reduce the environmental impact of IT systems. Participants will develop solutions that demonstrate efficient resource usage and minimize carbon footprint.

## Challenge Description
Participants are tasked with creating software solutions that incorporate GreenIT principles, emphasizing code quality, performance, security, and ecological impact. The goal is to apply simple yet effective strategies to avoid resource wastage.

### Core Requirements

#### Ecological Development Features
- Implement data pagination to reduce data transfer
- Minimize data payloads by default, with options for additional data selection
- Optimize code to reduce resource consumption (e.g., efficient memory management, avoiding unnecessary loops)
- Provide user feedback on the ecological impact of their actions (e.g., estimated CO2 impact of sending large emails)

#### Technical Requirements
1. **Code Optimization**
   - Refactor code to improve efficiency and reduce resource usage
   - Demonstrate before-and-after comparisons of code changes

2. **User Awareness**
   - Develop features that inform users about the ecological impact of their actions
   - Implement interfaces that allow users to make eco-friendly choices

3. **Performance and Security**
   - Ensure high code quality with a focus on performance and security
   - Implement secure data handling practices

### Evaluation Criteria

### Core Assessment (70%)
- Code quality and optimization (30%)
- Ecological impact reduction (25%)
- User awareness and interface design (15%)

### Bonus Features (30%)
- Innovative GreenIT solutions
