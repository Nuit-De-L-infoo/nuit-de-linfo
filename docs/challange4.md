# Application Supervision Challenge: Grafana Monitoring Stack

## Overview
This challenge, sponsored by MIPIHSIB (Healthcare Information Systems Specialist), focuses on implementing a comprehensive monitoring solution using Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter in a containerized environment.

## Challenge Description
Create a robust monitoring system using the Grafana stack to provide real-time insights into application and system health, performance metrics, and resource utilization. The solution should be fully containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.

### Technical Stack

#### Core Components
1. **Grafana**

   - Alert management
   - Node Exporter Full Dashboard implementation
   - Custom dashboard development

2. **Prometheus**
   - Metrics collection and storage
   - Query handling
   - Target monitoring
   - Alert rules configuration

3. **Node Exporter**
   - System metrics collection
   - Hardware monitoring
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Performance metrics gathering

### Implementation Requirements

#### Docker Configuration
- Docker Compose setup for all components
- Container orchestration
- Volume management for persistent data
- Network configuration between services

#### Monitoring Features
