# La Nuit de l'Info 2024 Challenge

## Overview
The challenge focuses on creating an educational and interactive web application that draws parallels between the ocean and the human body.

## Theme
**"What if the Ocean were a Human Body?"**

The goal is to demonstrate the critical importance of ocean preservation by comparing oceanic systems to human body systems.

### Key Analogies
- **Heart:** Ocean currents compared to the circulatory system
- **Lungs:** Gas exchange processes like photosynthesis and CO2 dissolution
- **Other Systems:** 
  - Salinity
  - Temperature
  - Marine life (plankton and coral)

## Application Requirements

### Features
- Interactive exploration of ocean-body parallels
- Audio/video integration
  - Podcast
  - Jingle

### Design Constraints
- Integratable into websites
- Usable at events on landscape screens
- Mobile-oriented with QR code support for on-site use
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Purpose
- Educate users on ocean importance
- Promote ocean preservation
- Inspire responsibility through immersive content
